# Voron BoxZero Mods and Configs

## Klipper Configurations and Macros

The included Klipper configurations are for an Octopus v1.1 MCU, a EBB36 v1.2 toolhead CAN board, Tri-Zero bed leveling, ZeroClick in the rear left corner, and a Sexbolt Z endstop. Modify as necessary for your configuration (especially your pinouts and stepper motor assignments) and be careful when first running any macros.
